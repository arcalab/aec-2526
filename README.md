# Introduction and objectives 

This course unit aims at preparing students to analyse algorithms (regarding
correctness and usage of resources, in particular execution time), as well as
to use algorithms over advanced data structures, including graphs. The unit
also introduces elementary algorithmic complexity concepts, such as the notion
of NP-complete problem.

The course is constituted by the following topics.

1. Introduction to the analysis of program correctness: pre and
   post-conditions; loop invariants; program annotation.
2. Execution time analysis: asymptotic complexity model; algorithmic
   strategies; recurrence equations; best case, worst case, and average case
analysis; amortized analysis; case studies.
3. Efficient data structures: AVL trees, hash tables, heaps. Efficient
   implementation of buffers and dictionaries.
4. Fundamental graph algorithms; the greedy and dynamic programming algorithmic
   strategies.
5. Introduction to the P, NP, and NP-complete classes of decision problems.

# Assessment

+ ([Ficha 1](tp1.pdf))  

Assessment is carried out through two tests (intermediate and final), both
weighing 50%. It is a requirement for successful evaluation that students
obtain a mark of at least 25% in both tests.
